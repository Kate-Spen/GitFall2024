The last book I read was Leviathan Wakes. It was a space opera science fiction novel about astronauts and a war between Earth and Mars. One of the main characters was the captain of a space crew and the other main character was a space cop. The setting was hundreds of years in the future where people lived on Earth, space stations, and Mars.
